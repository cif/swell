# Swell

## Champion of the unobligatory shortcut

Swell is a collection of node.js compilers and a thin core library of objects that **speed the development of javascript apps on both client and server.**

### Under the hood

Swell compiles [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) objects into javascript that extend [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) on the client and respond to requests made via [Express](http://expressjs.com/) / [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) on the server. [Socket.io](http://socket.io) allows for easy communication beteween multiple connected clients.  By default, Swell utilizes [Dust](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs/wiki/Dust-Tutorial) for templating (both client and server side) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) as a CSS preprocessor however it can be very easily adapted to use different client side tools.

### Exposure

Swell applications always expose the core [server](/page/server) modules giving you full control over the entire request and response pipeline. Core [client](/page/client) modules are also exposed and compiled in to your app realtime as opposed to being black-boxed in a vendor or public file.

### Not Isomorphic

[Isomorphic](http://isomorphic.net/) app runs the same code on both the client and the server. This is **not the case with Swell.**  Models and collections are **defined in one place** and extend what appears to be the same class however, when compiled they **extend two different objects** each of which is intened for the client or server &mdash; but not both!
