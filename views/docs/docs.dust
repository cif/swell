# Swell

## Champion of the unobligatory shortcut

Swell is **not a framework**, but rather a collection of compilers and a thin core library of objects that **speed the development of javascript apps.**

### Under the hood

Swell compiles [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) objects into javascript that extend [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) on the client and respond to requests made via [Express](http://expressjs.com/) / [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) on the server. A built-in [Socket.io](http://socket.io) instance allows for easy communication beteween multiple connected clients.  By default, Swell utilizes [Dust](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs/wiki/Dust-Tutorial) for templating (both client and server side) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) as a CSS preprocessor. You can always utilize other technologies to compress and package your static assets.

### Exposure

Swell applications always expose the core [server](/page/server) modules giving you full control over the entire request and response pipeline. Core [client](/page/client) modules are also exposed and compiled in to your app realtime as opposed to being black-boxed in a vendor or public file.

### Isomorphic... but not quite

For apps to be genuinely [isomorphic](http://isomorphic.net/), the code that comprises them runs on both the client and the server. This is **not *entirely* the case with Swell.**  Models and collections are **defined in one place** and extend what appears to be the same class, however when compiled they **extend two different objects** each of which intended to be run on the client or server &mdash; but not both!
