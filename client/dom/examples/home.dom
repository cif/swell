# Examples

This is a simple, one-collection, single page app that demonstrates some built-in client functionality along with code examples.  

This text is rendered by a method defined and called via the `home` (#home) in `client/routers/examples.coffee`. 

Notice how the hashtag changes while browing these pages. 

The [domly](https://github.com/lazd/DOMly) template markdown is contained in `client/dust/examples/home.dom`.
