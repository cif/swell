# swell.Form example

The main purpose of forms is to allow the manipulation of model properties. Validation can be turned on and off for realtime responses to changed inputs. 

There are several default [events](/page/api.client.form#events) which [swell.Form](/page/api.client.form) will broadcast when lists are interacted with.
