# Examples

This is a simple, one-collection, single page app with showing some built-in client functionality and code examples.  

This text is rendered by a method defined and called via `home` (#home) route in `client/routers/examples.coffee`. Notice how the hashtag changes while browing these pages. 

The dust template markdown is contained in `client/dust/examples/home.dust`.
